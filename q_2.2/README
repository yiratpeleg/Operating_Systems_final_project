HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN THE PROGRAM:

TO COMPILE:

There are 3 options:
1. make client - Will compile the client.c program and get a execution file named client.
2. make server - Will compile the server.c program and get a execution file named sserver.
3. make/make all - Will compile the client.c and server.c programs and get two execution files named client and server.

TO RUN:

You need to open two terminals. one for client and one for server.

To run the server, you need to run the following command:
./server

After you run the server, the server's pid will be printed on the screen so that when you run the client you will know which pid to enter.

To run the client, you need to run the following command:
./client <pid_of_server> <number_of_signal> <number_of_times>

NOTE: In our program, the number of signal must be 2(SIGINT) or 10(SIGUSR1).

To kill the server, you need press enter or use kill -9 <pid_of_server>

To remove the client and server files you need to run the following command:
make clean
