HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN THE PROGRAM:

TO COMPILE:

There are 3 options:
1. make
2. make all
3. make set_policy

All options will compile the set_policy.c program.

After compiling we get a execution file named set_policy.

TO RUN:

You need to run the following command:

./set_policy <number_of_policy> <number_of_priority>

The range of values of policy and priority:
The priority of SCHED_OTHER(0) policy is 0
The priority of SCHED_IDLE(5) policy is 0
The priority of SCHED_DEADLINE(6) policy is 0
The priority of SCHED_RR(2) policy is between 1 - 99
The priority of SCHED_FIFO(1) policy is between 1 - 99

After that you will get the pid of the process.
You need to press Enter to make the changes. 
Finally, to end the program, you need to enter 0.

To remove the set_policy file you need to run the following command:

make clean
