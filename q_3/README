HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN THE PROGRAM:

TO COMPILE:

There are 3 options:
1. make
2. make all
3. make set_policy

All options will compile the set_policy.c program.

After compiling we get a execution file named set_policy.

TO RUN:

You need to run the following command:

./set_policy <number_of_policy> <number_of_priority>

After that you will get the pid of the process.
You need to press Enter to make the changes. 
Finally, to end the program, you need to enter 0.

To remove the set_policy file you need to run the following command:

make clean
