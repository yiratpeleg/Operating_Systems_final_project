HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN THE PROGRAM:

TO COMPILE:

There are 3 options:
1. make
2. make all
3. make dir_traversal

All options will compile the dir_traversal.c program.

After compiling we get a execution file named dir_traversal.

TO RUN:

You need to run the following command:

./dir_traversal <Path_of_directory>

NOTE: If you don't enter a path, the default path is the current directory.

To remove the dir_traversal file you need to run the following command:

make clean
